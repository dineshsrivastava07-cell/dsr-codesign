# DSR CoDesign vs Figma AI — Open-Source Figma AI Alternative

Looking for an **open-source alternative to Figma AI** (Figma Make, Figma First Draft)? DSR CoDesign is an MIT-licensed desktop app that generates interactive UI prototypes directly in code — runnable, exportable, and under your control.

## At a glance

Figma AI is a suite of AI-assisted features inside Figma: prompt-to-draft, generative fills, content placeholders, auto-layout rewrites. Output stays inside the Figma canvas as frames and components.

DSR CoDesign starts from the opposite end: prompts become **code-native interactive prototypes** — HTML, React/JSX, PDF, PPTX — runnable and editable outside any proprietary canvas.

Pick **Figma AI** if your team lives inside Figma and the deliverable is always a canvas design that hands off to engineering.

Pick **DSR CoDesign** if you want the AI output to be real runnable code/artifacts from the start, with full model freedom and on-device privacy.

## Why someone would switch from Figma AI to DSR CoDesign

- **Output is code, not a canvas.** No design→code handoff step. The prompt produces the thing engineering actually ships.
- **Model choice.** Figma picks one model for you. DSR CoDesign lets you mix Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Ollama by task.
- **Cost control.** Use BYOK, local models, or an existing ChatGPT subscription. DSR CoDesign adds no platform margin.
- **On-device privacy.** Your prompts, designs, and any codebase scans stay on your machine.
- **Fewer seats.** You only pay Figma per-seat when you actually need Figma. DSR CoDesign is a free desktop app.
- **Export to PDF / PPTX / ZIP** without plugin chains.

## Why someone would stay on Figma AI

- Your team's source of truth *is* Figma — components, libraries, dev mode, hand-off.
- You design in the canvas, not in code.
- Real-time multiplayer editing is a hard requirement.

Different positions in the workflow. Most teams use both.

## Is DSR CoDesign a clone of Figma AI?

No. DSR CoDesign is an independent MIT-licensed desktop app by DSR-AI-Lab. It is not a Figma plugin, does not connect to the Figma API, and is not affiliated with Figma Inc. "Figma" and "Figma AI" are trademarks of Figma Inc.

## Install DSR CoDesign

- [90-second Quickstart](./quickstart)
- [Build from source](./quickstart#build-from-source)

## FAQ

- **Can DSR CoDesign import my Figma files?** Not yet. Codebase → design-system token extraction ships in v0.4. Figma-file ingest is not on the v1 roadmap.
- **Does it replace Figma entirely?** No — it replaces the AI-generation step. Many teams will keep Figma for collaboration and use DSR CoDesign for prompt-to-prototype.
- **Can I use local models?** Yes — any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, Ollama included.
- **License?** MIT.
